An AngularJS/Grails ToDo List
==============
This is a simple web ToDo app built with an AngularJS client<br>
and a Grails application server.<br>
It might not be the best application, but this is my<br>
introductory app to web developement, made for my<br>
training at my University's software department.<br>
I intend to add comments at some point, and feel free to<br>
use this as an example, it should be fairly simple to follow.
