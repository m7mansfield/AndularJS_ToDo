An AngularJS/Grails ToDo List
==============
This is a simple web ToDo app built with an AngularJS client
and a Grails application server.
It might not be the best application, but this is my
introductory app to web developement, made for my
training at my University's software department.
I intend to add comments at some point, and feel free to
use this as an example, it should be fairly simple to follow.
